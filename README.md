# GameofLife
A Java implementation of Conway's Game of Life.

It operates on a 200x200 pixel grid. One MAY try and configure starting positions, but the user-inputting is currently very tedious. The program has been constructed to observe random variations of the game over user-chosen amounts of generations. User-inputting will be improved over time.

The console is used to input values and communicate with the application.
